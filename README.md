## 🤔 What is this?

A scientifically accurate* simulator of a developer's life where you must choose between:
- Working in IT
- Making Money
- Mental Sanity

**Spoiler Alert:** You can only choose TWO. Just like in real life!

\* *Not actually scientific, but every developer knows it's true.*

## 🖥️ Demo

## ✨ Features

- 🌈 **The Developer's Trilemma**: Attempt the impossible - try to have all three aspects of a developer's life!
- 🌙 **Dark Mode**: Because no real developer uses light mode after 10 PM (or before).
- 🌐 **Multilingual**: Suffer in Portuguese, English, or Spanish! Your choice!
- 💾 **State Persistence**: We'll remember your life choices, even if you try to refresh them away.
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Experience existential crisis on any device!

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML - Because even the most depressing truths need structure
- CSS - Making life's harsh realities look pretty
- JavaScript - Adding interactivity to your inevitable failure
- localStorage - Remembering your poor life choices

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A web browser
- A sense of humor
- Low expectations about work-life balance

## 🎮 How to Use

1. Try to activate all three switches
2. Fail
3. Question your career choices
4. Repeat
